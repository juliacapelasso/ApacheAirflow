# ApacheAirflow
In this repository, I created the file "climate_data.py" which retrieves data from an API and sets up a DAG to extract the data on a daily basis and store it in a folder. This process was done in Python (VS Code) and the automation was done using Apache Airflow. 
I also have included some evidence of my DAG working on Airflow.
